# beanseditor

don't forget the | beans |

### Note-taking app

 - beans == notes 
 - Made purely because Samsung Notes was bloated and lacked dark mode
 - Forked the rich text editor Zefyr
   - Added ability to change text color
   - Added strikethrough, removed (at the time) buggy underline attribute
